bugfixes:
  - Fix host_begins_with_any, host_is_any, server_name_is_any and host_is_not_any parameters of the bigip_policy_rule
    module to enforce list as the required parameter type. Change was required since in Ansible a string conversion is
    applied when the provided argument type is not matching the expected one causing undesired side effects.
