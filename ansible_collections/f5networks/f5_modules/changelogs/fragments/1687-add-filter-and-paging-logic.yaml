major_changes:
    - bigip_device_info - the module no longer gathers information from all partitions on device. This change will stabalize the module by gathering resources only from the given partition and prevent the module from gathering way too much information that might result in crashing.
    - bigip_device_info - pagination logic has also been added to help with api stability.
