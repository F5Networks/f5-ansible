# Test the bigip_device_info module
#
# Running this playbook assumes that you have a BIG-IP installation at the
# ready to receive the commands issued in this Playbook.
#
# This module will run tests against a BIG-IP host to verify that the
# bigip_device_info module behaves as expected.
#
# Usage:
#
#    ansible-playbook -i notahost, playbooks/bigip_device_info.yaml
#
# Examples:
#
#    Run all tests on the bigip_device_info module
#
#    ansible-playbook -i notahost, playbooks/bigip_device_info.yaml

# changed these tests not to fail completely as some tests will fail due to differences between VE versions
