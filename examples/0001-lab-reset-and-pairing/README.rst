Reset licenses and synchronize BIG-IPs
======================================

These playbooks are a set of examples contributed by F5'er Nathan Wehrman. In his
own words:

  I wasnâ€™t sure if these are useful to others or not. Nothing super fancy but
  this will allow you to configure two boxes, reset the license and set up some
  basic items. Then you can use the pair device playbook to use `tmsh` and put
  the devices into a pair.

  Handy for a quick/consistent lab setup and downgrading a pair for testing.

We hope these examples can help familiarize you with the usage of the F5 Modules for Ansible
in your own organization's playbooks.
