Ansible F5
==========

|slack badge| |travis badge| |shippable badge|

Introduction
------------

This repository provides the foundation for working with the F5 Modules for Ansible.
The architecture of the modules makes inherent use of the BIG-IP REST APIs as well as the tmsh API where required.

This repository is an **incubator** for Ansible modules. The modules in this repository **may be
broken due to experimentation or refactoring**.

If you want to download the stable modules, please install latest collection release found at |f5_collection|

The F5 Modules for Ansible are freely provided to the open source community for automating BIG-IP device configurations.


Collections Daily Build
-----------------------
We offer a daily build of our most recent collection at |dailycollectionbuild|.

Please use this Collection to test the most recent Ansible module updates between releases.

Installing the Daily Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: shell

    ansible-galaxy collection install <collection name> -p ./collections
    e.g.
    ansible-galaxy collection install f5networks-f5_modules-1.0.0-devel.tar.gz -p ./collections

.. note::

   "-p" is the location in which the collection will be installed. This location should be defined in the path for
   ansible to search for collections. An example of this would be adding ``collections_paths = ./collections``
   to your **ansible.cfg**

Support
-------
F5 supports the F5 modules delivered in |ansible_distro|. Please refer to the |support_policy| for details.

Bugs, Issues
------------

Please file any bugs, questions, or enhancement requests by using |ansible_issues|. For details, see |ansiblegethelp|.

Documentation
-------------

All documentation is available on |ansiblehelp|.

Your ideas
----------

What types of modules do you want created? If you have a use case and can sufficiently describe the behavior you want to see, open an issue and we will hammer out the details.

If you've got the time, consider sending an email that introduces yourself and what you do. We love hearing about how you're using the F5 Modules for Ansible.
