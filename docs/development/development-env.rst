Development environment
=======================

This document covers development tools that make developing F5 Ansible modules significantly easier.

Getting Started
---------------

This document assumes that you are working on a \*nix, or \*nix-like environment.

The workstation in the examples is a Mac running Sierra (10.12.6). Some of the steps will not be relevant
to other environments. When that happens, it will be noted.

Amongst the topics of this document are the following:

- Choosing an IDE
- REST communication
- Virtualization tools
- Docker
- Getting the source
- sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 1.2.3.4

This document ultimately serves as a gateway to all the other development-related documents on this site.
You will be unable to follow the other development documents without having the setup outlined here.

Choosing an IDE
---------------

F5 uses the PyCharm IDE to write the Ansible modules.

- https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

The developers use the Professional edition, but there is also a Community edition available.

You can use other editors as you see fit, but this document uses the above editor.

A vanilla installation of PyCharm is sufficient.

With an editor in place, it is time for you to get a tool that will facilitate your ability to speak with the F5 device's REST API.

REST communication
------------------

You can use a variety of tools to introspect a REST API, but Postman is the one that we used for the F5 Ansible modules.

You can use this tool in two ways:

- As a way to communicate with F5 devices during development
- As a way for contributors to provide API workflows to the Ansible module developers

You can download Postman from the following URL.

- https://www.getpostman.com/

It comes in two parts. First, there is the `postman` tool itself which is a GUI tool that you can use to interact
with remote REST APIs. Second, there is a CLI tool called `newman` which you can use to run batches of API calls.
These batches are usually in the form of what Postman refers to as "Collections".

We do not use `newman`.

Virtualization tools
--------------------

For the primary needs of development and test we use VE (Virtual Edition) instances of F5 product to do our work.

To run these VE products, you have two options:

- OpenStack
- Virtualbox/VMWare/some local solution

You options are limited to the platform that you choose to do development on. Mac and hardware-based Linux
installations have the largest breadth of options. We'll explain why this is, shortly.

As mentioned, all development platforms can support OpenStack. This is because our
usage of OpenStack's client libraries is constrained to the Docker dev/test
containers. Once you are in the container, you should have all the tools necessary
to perform your work.

You can use the OpenStack tools by using the "plumbing" commands;
`openstack stack create`, `openstack server create`, etc. Or, you can use the porcelain commands; `f5ansible harness-create`,
`f5ansible harness-delete`,
etc. F5 recommends that you use the porcelain commands.

I also mentioned that, for certain platforms, you have access to local dev tools.
I specifically mentioned Mac and hardware Linux because there is a limitation in
Windows in which you can only run one hypervisor.

Docker for Windows requires that HyperV be turned on in Windows. However, doing this
prevents you from using Virtualbox. You can, alternatively, use HyperV itself in
Vagrant, but at this time this is not a method that works by the development team. YMMV.

If you are using the aforementioned Mac or hardware Linux, we provide both public
and private (internal) copies of Vagrantfiles for you to use.

For public Vagrantfiles, refer to the following URL

* https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-vagrant-files

For private Vagrantfiles, refer to your F5 colleague.

Docker
------

Since the F5 Ansible modules are written in Python, it's required that we have
the different installations of Python available to us. To do this, we provide
a `docker-compose.yaml` file that has all the necessary Python environments.

`docker-compose` *should* come with docker by default. If not, you can install it
by following the instructions here.

- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

To make use of this requires the following two steps.

First, you will need to build the initial containers. You do not need to rebuild containers frequently; only if we change the base `Dockerfile`.

To build the initial container, you will want to know what the existing Python
environments that we support are.

You can get this information with the following command

- `docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml config --services`

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   (ansible-dev) SEA-ML-RUPP1:f5-ansible trupp$ docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml config --services
   docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml config --services
   py2.7.10
   py3.5.4
   py3.6.2
   (ansible-dev) SEA-ML-RUPP1:f5-ansible trupp$

Once you have chosen the environment that you want, you can proceed to build.
Suppose you were interested in Python 3.6.2. You could build that development
environment with the following command.

- `docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml build py3.6.2`

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   (ansible-dev) SEA-ML-RUPP1:f5-ansible trupp$ docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml build --no-cache py3.6.2
   docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml build py3.6.2
   Building py3.6.2
   Step 1/11 : FROM python:2.7
    ---> 416af6c21fa5
   ...
   Removing intermediate container 32dce77d8634
   Step 11/11 : CMD ['/bin/bash']
    ---> Running in dc5557ae0583
    ---> f6684c7280f9
   Removing intermediate container dc5557ae0583

   Successfully built f6684c7280f9
   Successfully tagged python:3.6
   (ansible-dev) SEA-ML-RUPP1:f5-ansible trupp$

Building will take a minute or two the first time that you do it. After your
initial build, you will no longer need to re-build the container unless we
specifically change the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yaml` file.

.. note::

   I am deliberately using the `--no-cache` argument. This will cause the
   build to take slightly longer because it will not be re-using existing Docker
   layers. The upside, is that you do not need to be concerned with any old artifacts
   from former layers sticking around to cause problems with the build.

Finally, to make use of the new container, you can use the `run` argument to
`docker-compose`, instead of the `build` argument.

* `docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml run py3.6.2`

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   (ansible-dev) SEA-ML-RUPP1:f5-ansible trupp$ docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml run py3.6.2
   docker-compose -f devtools/docker-compose.yaml run py3.6.2
   root@cd71daf91439:/here#

You will immediately be dropped into the container environment. From within this
container, you can run all the Ansible/py.test/etc commands that you need to do
development of the `f5-ansible` source code.

Also, it should be noted that you can continue to use external development tools
(like IDEs) and all the changes you make in them will be immediately reflected
in your container environment. This is made possible by a bound volume in your
container that references the `f5-ansible` source tree.

.. note::

   Local development usually happens with local F5 product running in Virtualbox
   VMs. The tools for doing this are not packaged in this container, nor are the
   Vagrantfiles for bringing up those devices. If you are external to F5, we
   provide means to make your own at the following repositories

   * https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-packer-templates
   * https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-vagrant-files

   Internal F5 engineers can contact the maintainers of this code-base for
   pointers on internal resources that are available.

Local Ansible source copy
-------------------------

It is required that you have a locally available source copy of the Ansible upstream
codebase. To do this, you must do the following

1. In Github, create a fork of the Ansible codebase. You can find this codebase here https://github.com/ansible/ansible.
   You can use the `Fork` button in the top right of
   the screen to fork it. Please fork it to your __personal__ Github
   account.

2. Clone your fork to the `local/` directory in this (f5-ansible) source tree. You can do this like so.
   `git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/ansible.git local/ansible`.
   Replace `USERNAME` with your Github username.

3. Add a `git` remote pointing to the "upstream" ansible source tree. You can do this
   from __within__ the `local/ansible/` directory. From there, issue this command,
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ansible/ansible`

With this setup in place, you now have the ability to do the following

- Copy f5-ansible source code "upstream" so that you can merge it into Ansible
- Re-create the integration test playbook that Ansible uses for `bigip_*` modules.
- Run all upstream PR tests that you need to run when upstreaming a new module to
  Ansible core.

We will add more things that you "can do" as they become appropriate.

Merging from other contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At times it may be necessary to track other contributors source trees and test
their fixes.

The times that this is particularly import are,

* When the contributor has changed something in module_utils/ related to F5
  (for example f5_utils.py or in f5networks/).
* When the contributor has changed something in a plugin that is related to F5
  (for example an action or terminal plugin).

The reason that the procedure below is important is because it allows you to test
their changes without needing to care about exposing any internal services (such
as testing harnesses) to the outside world. Since that is strictly forbidden, it's
easier to just do the following.

* With the above local checkout of the Ansible source code in place, start by
  changing into that source code directory and adding a git `remote` for the
  repo that you want to test stuff from.

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd local/ansible
     git remote add CONTRIBUTOR https://github.com/CONTRIBUTOR/ansible.git`

* Next, fetch the content of their repository so that you can use it locally

  .. code-block:: bash

     git fetch CONTRIBUTOR

* Next, ask the contributor which branch they have been doing their development
  on. Suppose its name was `feature.foo-bar-baz`. With this information in mind,
  you would next checkout the given branch and supply the `--track` argument to
  git. This will create a local copy of the branch just for you, and will
  additionally configure `git` so that a `git pull` will pull directly from the
  CONTRIBUTOR's repo and specific branch you are using.

  .. code-block:: bash

     git checkout --track CONTRIBUTOR/feature.foo-bar-baz

* You are have the CONTRIBUTOR source at the ready. It is recommended that you
  install it in a separate `virtualenv`. We can make use of the `mkvirtualenv`
  command for this. Note that I am referencing the `requirements.test.txt` file
  from the `f5-ansible` repository.

  .. code-block:: bash

     mkvirtualenv ansible-CONTRIBUTOR
     pip install -r ../../requirements.test.txt

* With your virtualenv created, install the CONTRIBUTORS branch that you checked
  out earlier. Replace F5_ANSIBLE_PATH with the local path to your f5-ansible
  fork.

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install file:///F5_ANSIBLE_PATH/local/ansible

* You are now fully ready to test anything that the CONTRIBUTOR wants you to
  test.

f5ansible command
-----------------

This repository provides a convenience command for you to use both inside and outside
the dev/test containers in this repo.

The command is called `f5ansible` and it is in the `devtools/bin` directory
of this repository.

F5 recommends that you add the `bash` completions as well as the path to this
command to you local `$PATH` variable. YOu can do this by adding the following
to your `~/.bashrc` file,

.. code-block:: bash

   eval "$(_F5ANSIBLE_COMPLETE=source /PATH/TO/f5-ansible/devtools/bin/f5ansible)"
   export PATH=$PATH:/PATH/TO/f5-ansible/devtools/bin/

Be sure to change the `/PATH/TO` value above to reflect the settings that you have
on **your** system.

With this configuration in place, you can restart your terminal. Once you have, you
will find that you now have an `f5ansible` command available in your $PATH (which
means that you can use the TAB key to auto-complete it).

Additionally, you can tab complete the `f5ansbile` command, and then continue to
press TAB twice or more to get the list of sub-commands that the `f5ansible` command
provides.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   SEA-ML-00028116:f5-ansible trupp$ f5ansible
   container-run    module-stub      module-upstream
   SEA-ML-00028116:f5-ansible trupp$ f5ansible


Questions
=========

Below are a variety of development environment related questions that I've been
asked and answers to each

* What is the smallest incarnation of an F5 that I can use in my lab to
  test playbooks?

I use vagrant boxes for this if I'm doing local testing. For vagrant boxes you
need to build your own, however we provide packerfiles to do that

https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-packer-templates

and the associated vagrant files

https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-vagrant-files

Otherwise, I use VE's on OpenStack. The base VE image should be sufficient to
run on OpenStack. I use the OVA's that we distribute because that's what works
with our OpenStack distro.

* Is there a way to get one of those and/or licensing for virtual devices?

You can get any pre-built images from downloads.f5.com (free registration) but
you will indeed need a license to make much use of it. You can acquire a license
through sales or, in special cases, through a business partnership with F5.
