F5 Networks Contributor License Agreement
=========================================

Before you can contribute to any project sponsored by F5 Networks, Inc. (F5) on GitHub, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

If you sign as an individual, you should talk to your employer (if applicable) before signing the CLA, because some employment agreements may have restrictions on your contributions to other projects.

Otherwise, by submitting a CLA, you represent that you are legally entitled to grant the licenses recited therein.

If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, such as your contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions, or that your employer has executed a separate CLA with F5.

If you are signing on behalf of a company, you represent that you are legally entitled to grant the license recited therein. You represent further that each employee of the entity that submits contributions has authorization to submit such contributions on behalf of the entity pursuant to the CLA.
