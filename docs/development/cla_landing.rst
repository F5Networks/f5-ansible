F5 Networks Contributor License Agreement
=========================================

Before you start contributing to any project sponsored by F5 Networks,
Inc. (F5) on GitHub, you will need to sign a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). If you are signing as an individual, we recommend that
you talk to your employer (if applicable) before signing the CLA since
some employment agreements may have restrictions on your contributions
to other projects. Otherwise by submitting a CLA you represent that you
are legally entitled to grant the licenses recited therein. If your
employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, such as
your contributions, you represent that you have received permission to
make contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has
waived such rights for your contributions, or that your employer has
executed a separate CLA with F5.\
If you are signing on behalf of a company, you represent that you are
legally entitled to grant the license recited therein. You represent
further that each employee of the entity that submits contributions is
authorized to submit such contributions on behalf of the entity pursuant
to the CLA.
